# Portfolio Project
This was a project that I developed as part of my [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). I was given a PDF mockup of a portfolio site to translate into a web page using HTML and CSS. I chose to customize the content and spotlight my love of the outdoors.
